# Analysis-of-Nurburgring-Lap-Record

Motorsport, sporting events involving the use and racing of motor vehicles such as automobiles 
and motor motorcycles, had gained its popularity and attention since the automotive industry 
began to emerge in the late 19th century and it was even featured twice in the Olympics events 
(although being unofficial) during the summers of 1900 and 1936. 

Nowadays, for automobiles, racing events are held annually at regional, national, international 
and championship levels. For these races, the vehicles used range from road-legal and market
available high performance cars to non-road-legal prototypes specifically designed for the races, 
the racing tracks are usually in the form of closed rings (raceway) and occasionally temporarily 
closed public roads and the variety of landscapes and road conditions brings challenges to the 
races, and drivers compete with each other by either ranking individual’s time in finishing the 
track (when the drivers run on the track one by one) or by ranking the order and time in which 
drivers finish the track (when all drivers run on the track at the same time).   

In such a sporting event, the performance of the vehicles, competitors’ driving skills and track 
conditions all contribute to the final racing score or the lap record (this term will be used 
throughout this paper to refer to the time it takes to complete any track). However, when all 
competitors, each possessing the same driving skills, are driving on the same track under the 
same road conditions and performing under their optimal conditions, the performance of the 
vehicles become a decisive factor in determining the lap time. This intuition leads to the question 
of which technical features of the vehicle and to what extend they impact the lap records, which 
motivates the following study of the statistical relationship between the performance data of 54 
different vehicles and their corresponding lap records at Nürburgring. More specifically, multiple 
linear regression model is fitted with lap records being the response variable and the key 
measurements of a vehicle’s performance as predictor variables. The adjusted R squared value indicates 
that 65% of the lap records are justified by the selected vehicle performance measuring factors.
